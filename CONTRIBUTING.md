## Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to the Mars Arena engine! We welcome improvements, bug fixes, and new ideas. To help the process go smoothly, please keep in mind the following guidelines:

* **Issues and Bugs:** If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on GitHub. Provide as much detail as possible (including reproduction steps, if applicable).
* **Discussion:** For significant changes or design decisions, it’s a good idea to start a discussion or issue first to get feedback from the maintainers and community. This helps ensure your idea aligns with the project goals.
* **Pull Requests:** Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes. Make commits with clear messages explaining *what* and *why* you changed something. When ready, open a Pull Request. Describe your changes in detail in the PR description and mention any related issue numbers (e.g., “Closes #12”).
* **Coding Style:** Try to follow the style of the existing code. The project is in Zinc/vJass, so make sure you’re familiar with those conventions. Use meaningful variable and function names. Keep the code organized similarly to how existing systems are set up. Adding comments to explain complex logic is appreciated.
* **Testing Your Changes:** Whenever possible, test your changes in Warcraft III to ensure they work as intended and do not introduce new bugs. If your change affects core systems (like damage calculation or buffs), verify those systems still behave correctly.
* **License:** By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same MIT License that covers this project.

We appreciate every contribution. Even small fixes or improvements can help a lot. Feel free to ask questions by opening an issue or reaching out to maintainers if you need guidance.
